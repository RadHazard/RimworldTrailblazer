# TODO list:

- Optimize the pathfinders
- Write unit tests using RimTest
  - Write tests for each rule
  - Write tests for each pathfinder
- Cache passibility/cost for cells?
  - At the moment, both seem to be only minor contributors to the full pathfinding cost
- Expand debug visualizations
  - Show costs for individual rules
  - Pathfinder-specific visualization
- Profile various rules to make sure we're running efficiently
